1. Entry Point: FabrickAPIClient.class
2. For DB transactions savings: Edit persistence.xml accordingly to your environment and add your driver dependency to pom.xml 
3. Manually set FabrickAPIClient.SAVE_TRANSACTIONS_TO_DB to skip savings to DB
4. Sandbox MoneyTransfer API always returns http 403. This feature was not tested.

I hope you enjoy it.
